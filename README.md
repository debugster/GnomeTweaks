#### On Ubuntu
```bash
wget -nv -O Release.key \
  https://build.opensuse.org/projects/home:manuelschneid3r/public_key
sudo apt-key add - < Release.key
sudo apt update
sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/manuelschneid3r/xUbuntu_18.04/ /' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/home:manuelschneid3r.list"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install albert
```
#### On Kali
```bash
wget -nv -O Release.key \
  https://build.opensuse.org/projects/home:manuelschneid3r/public_key
sudo apt-key add - < Release.key
sudo apt update
sudo echo 'deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/manuelschneid3r/Debian_Testing/ /' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/home:manuelschneid3r.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install albert
```
- After installation, you can open Albert from Menu/Dash and set hotkey to activate albert.

# Known Issues
### System Monitor, Calculator don't use GTK Themes (on Ubuntu)
- This is because those applications are installed as snap packages. To verify, execute:
```bash
snap list
```
- The snap execution environment doesn't see any of the themes on your system (local or system-wide). So this is somewhat an expected behaviour.
- As a workaround, you may want to remove those snap applications. To remove those, execute:
```bash
sudo snap remove gnome-system-monitor
sudo snap remove gnome-calculator
```
- And install their apt versions. To install, execute:
```bash
sudo apt install gnome-system-monitor gnome-calculator
```
